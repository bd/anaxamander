# Success stories:

Let's understand our work in the context of people who the software serves, and in the context of people it affects. 

###Provide a new team-member another, high-bandwidth channel for learning a project. 
If we have a tool that can draw useful images of the software on command, we address the problem of documentation's blurring between spec, history, and bug tracker. Or in more cases, never existing to begin with.

###Cartographic services for strategic discussion with non-technical stakeholders. 
Give technical execs, managers, and whomever else needs it useful, engaging tools to present and explain issues arising in the code to those for whom code is, as it were, greek.
