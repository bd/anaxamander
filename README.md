# Anaxamander

###  A cartographer for source code

Anaxamander is named for the eponymous pre-Socratic philosopher, known for, among other things, his attempt to map the known world. This software attempts to map ES/JS source code and so to provide a comprehensible visual guide to the flow of control within the codebase.

## Development

This is experimental and primarily intended as an exercise in static analysis and exploration graph-databases for its primary (and currently, sole) author. Be not dismayed if no viable product emerges from this repo. Yet, with the blessing, we may produce a generally useful tool.
